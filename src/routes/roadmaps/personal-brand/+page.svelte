      Personal Brand Roadmap

    <TestimonialCard title="Step 1: Define Your Foundation">

        <div class="w-full md:w-1/2">
          <p>
            At this point it's important to map your strengths, goals, motivations, resources (network, skills, capital, etc.) and viable business models.
            <br /><br />
            You'll need to create a solid psychological foundation to push through the ups and downs, resistance, and also get an understanding of where your skills, natural aptitudes, and unique positioning meet a market desire.
          </p>

            Laying out the full inner and outer map of yourself and your situation is pivotal to charting a course ahead. Sometimes this is skipped over, but it's always a mistake. Your mental game is JUST as important as the game itself.

    <TestimonialCard title="Step 2: Study Proven Models">
      <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-between items-start gap-8">
        <div class="w-full md:w-1/2">
          <p>
            Analyze what still works in your niche. How are people making money? What kind of ways, and how much are they making? Where are their customers coming from?
            <br />
            • Patreon? Courses? Live events?<br />
            • YouTube → Email → Paid product?
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="w-full md:w-1/2 flex flex-col gap-4">
          <p>
            Most of the time, it's unnecessary to craft a new business model, especially if you don't have a financial padding against making mistakes. Figure out what's working, and then make those systems work for you.

    <TestimonialCard title="Step 3: Get Visible">
      <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-between items-start gap-8">
        <div class="w-full md:w-1/2">
          <p>
            Time to publish consistently on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok — wherever your people are, and whatever medium naturally resonates with you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="w-full md:w-1/2 flex flex-col gap-4">
          <p>
            Do whatever it takes to be consistent. Treat this as a skill - learning how to find people who resonate with you is a mix of being yourself to the absolute max, and also communicating in a way that's likely to cut through the noise.
            Getting good at this gives you the keys to the kingdom, because most people who are great at a craft, tend to refuse to do enough promotion, despite having tremendous amounts to offer.

    <TestimonialCard title="Step 4: Remove Blockers (Optional but Critical)">

        <div class="w-full md:w-1/2">

            Can’t post consistently? Time to audit:
            <br />
            • Time<br />
            • Energy<br />
            • Motivation<br />
            • Skill gaps
          </p>

        <figure class="w-full md:w-1/2 flex flex-col gap-4">
          <p>
            Sometimes therapy or coaching is the fix, to start working through old patterns that are blocking you. Highly recommended as part of the work.

            Time to start tracking
            <br />
            • Views → Email signups<br />
            • Engagement trends<br />
            • Content performance

            Make offerings at multiple price points and formats.
            <br /><br />
            Digital courses, coaching, templates, memberships, high ticket one-on-one — tailored to your audience.
          </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="w-full md:w-1/2 flex flex-col gap-4">
          <p>
            You want to create an offer ladder that people can engage, invest, and get to know you better. This sometimes can solve major issues in conversion that looked unsolvable before.

            Launch offer → Free content → Launch again
            <br /><br />
            Launch an offer that makes sense through your content channel.

        <figure class="w-full md:w-1/2 flex flex-col gap-4">

            This is an ongoing process so the sooner you can get started and get into a rhythm the better.
            Track conversions. Fix weak points. Scale what works.

            Post-launch: what broke?
            <br />
            • Cart abandonment?<br />
            • Conversion drop off?<br />
            • No-shows?<br />
            • Support overload?
